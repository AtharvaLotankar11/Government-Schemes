## Overview

The **Government Schemes Portal** is a simple, user-friendly web application designed to help users explore and discover various government schemes. It serves as an informational platform where users can browse through a comprehensive list of schemes, access official links, and filter results based on their interests.

The portal aims to bridge the gap between government initiatives and citizens by providing easy access to scheme details in one place.
